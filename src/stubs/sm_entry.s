    ; SM was no protection domain switch. This basically means that once an IRQ
    ; has occurred, we cannot call normal entry points anymore. Since it is nice
    ; to be able to use unprotected SMs during testing, and it is quiet common
    ; to have interrupts disabled then, the caller ID will always be that of the
    ; reset IRQ (0xffff). Since there is no valid use case of actually handling
    ; a reset inside an SM (since the reset will disable all SMs), we simply
